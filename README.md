Recognizes Sudokus of any size as long as it's a multiple of 3 (Specify the size in the code parameters).

When scanning, cells will be marked in red in the preview until it finds all of the cells, then they will turn blue. If all the numbers are scanned correctly, the solution will be displayed over the Sudoku in the preview.
